# Lesson 1 

follow this video to get a general overview of how WPILIB works and how robot code is structured 
It is a bit of a knowledge dump but has lots of great content, don't worry about understanding everything 100% 
try your best to keep up and ask questions if you are very stuck or confused 

**(you can skip the `WPILIB installation and setup` section of the video as that was already covered in a previous lesson)**
