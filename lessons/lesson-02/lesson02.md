# Lesson 2 

This video walks through how to create a drivetrain subsystem and an associated command to control the drivetrain. This will introduce you 
to the basic structure of how to write code for robotics. In the next lesson, you will be implementing what you learned to write another 
(slightly different) drivetrain subsystem and associated commands to control one of our actual robots.
